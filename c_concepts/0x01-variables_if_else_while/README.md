# Variables

* A variable in C is a memory location associated with some name in order to store some form of data and retrieve it when required. 
* We can store different types of data in the variable and reuse the same variable for storing some other data any number of times.
* For using a variable in C, we have to first define it to tell the compiler about its existence so that compiler can allocate the required memory to it.

## Syntax:
~~~~
data_type variable_name = value;    /* defining single variable */
	OR
data_type variable_name1, variable_name2;    /* defining multiple variable */
~~~~
