# Relational Operators

* In C, relational operators are used to compare values and determine the relationship between them. These operators return a Boolean result (true or false) based on the evaluation of the comparison. 

* Here are the relational operators available in C:
	* Equal to (==): This operator checks if two values are equal. It returns true if the values are equal and false otherwise.
~~~~
int a = 5;
int b = 7;
if (a == b) {
    // Executes if a is equal to b
}
~~~~
	* Not equal to (!=): This operator checks if two values are not equal. It returns true if the values are different and false if they are equal.
~~~~
int a = 5;
int b = 7;
if (a != b) {
    // Executes if a is not equal to b
}
~~~~

	* Greater than (>): This operator checks if the left value is greater than the right value. It returns true if the condition is satisfied and false otherwise.
~~~~
int a = 5;
int b = 7;
if (a > b) {
    // Executes if a is greater than b
}
~~~~

	* Less than (<): This operator checks if the left value is less than the right value. It returns true if the condition is satisfied and false otherwise.
~~~~
int a = 5;
int b = 7;
if (a < b) {
    // Executes if a is less than b
}
~~~~

	* Greater than or equal to (>=): This operator checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value. It returns true if the condition is satisfied and false otherwise.
~~~~
int a = 5;
int b = 7;
if (a >= b) {
    // Executes if a is greater than or equal to b
}
~~~~

#### Relational operators are commonly used in conditional statements (e.g., if, while, for) to make decisions based on the comparison of values. The result of a relational expression can be assigned to a Boolean variable or directly used in control flow statements to determine the execution path of the program.

### Always remember that true = 1, false = 0
* " less than < "
* " greater than > "
* " = equal to "
* " != not equal to "
* " <= less than or equal to " 
* " >= greater than or equal to "
