#Increment and Decrement Operators in C
* The decrement (--) and increment (++) operators are special types of operators used in programming languages to decrement and increment the value of the given variable by 1 (one), respectively.

## Types of Increment and Decrement Operators in C
* Prefix Increment operator
* Prefix Decrement operator
* Postfix Increment operator
* Postfix Decrement operator

## ++i Pre Increment 
* Pre-increment operator is used to increment the value of a variable before using it in an expression. In the Pre-Increment, value is first incremented and then used inside the expression.

### Syntax
~~~~
a = ++x;
~~~~

## i++ Post Increment
* Post-increment operator is used to increment the value of the variable after executing the expression completely in which post-increment is used. In the Post-Increment, value is first used in an expression and then incremented.

### Syntax
~~~~
a = x++;
~~~~
