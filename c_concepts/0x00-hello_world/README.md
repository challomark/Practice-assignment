# C PROGRAMMING

* C programming is a widely used programming language that was originally developed in the 1970s. It was created by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs as an evolution of the earlier B programming language. C has since become one of the most popular and influential programming languages in the world.

* C is a general-purpose programming language that is known for its simplicity, efficiency, and low-level control over computer hardware. It provides a wide range of programming constructs and features, making it suitable for a variety of applications, including system programming, embedded systems, game development, and more.

* One of the key features of C is its ability to directly manipulate memory and perform low-level operations, such as bit manipulation and pointer arithmetic. This gives programmers a high degree of control and allows for efficient coding, especially in situations where performance is critical.

* C is a structured programming language, which means it supports modular programming through functions and code blocks. It also includes a rich set of standard libraries that provide pre-written code for various tasks, such as input/output operations, string handling, mathematical calculations, and more.

* Another important aspect of C is its portability. Programs written in C can be compiled and run on different computer architectures with minimal modifications, making it highly portable across various platforms and operating systems.

* C has influenced the development of many other programming languages, including C++, C#, Objective-C, and Java, among others. Learning C provides a solid foundation for understanding these languages and delving into systems-level programming.

* Overall, C is a powerful and versatile programming language that continues to be widely used and taught due to its efficiency, performance, and extensive use in various domains.

## Comments

* In C programming, comments are used to add explanatory or descriptive text within the source code. Comments are ignored by the compiler and do not affect the execution of the program. They serve as notes for programmers or as a way to disable certain lines of code temporarily.

* There are two ways to write comments in C:
	* Single-line comments: To create a comment that spans a single line, you can use two forward slashes (//) followed by the comment text. Anything after the // symbol on the same line will be considered a comment. Here's an example:
~~~~
// This is a single-line comment in C
int x = 10; // This is another comment
~~~~

	* Multi-line comments: To create comments that span multiple lines, you can enclose the comment text between /* and */ symbols. Everything between these symbols, regardless of line breaks, will be treated as a comment. Here's an example:
~~~~
/* This is a multi-line comment
   in C programming.
   It can span multiple lines. */
int y = 20;
/* This is another comment */
~~~~

* It's good practice to include comments in your code to make it more readable and understandable, especially for complex or critical sections of code. Comments can help other programmers (or even yourself) understand the purpose, logic, or any specific details about the code, making it easier to maintain and debug in the future.
