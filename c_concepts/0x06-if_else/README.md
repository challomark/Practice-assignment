# If Statements in C
## Basic If Syntax

* The structure of an if statement is as follows:
~~~~	
if ( statement is TRUE )
	Execute this line of code

if ( 5 < 10 )
	printf("Five is now less than ten, that's a big surprise");

if ( TRUE ) {
	/* between the braces is the body of the if statement */
	Execute all statements inside the body
}
~~~~
* Always put braces following if statements.
