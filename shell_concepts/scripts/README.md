# Shell Scripting

* Shell scripting refers to writing scripts or programs using shell commands and scripting features to automate tasks and perform operations in a shell environment. 

* Shell scripts are typically written in scripting languages such as Bash, Zsh, or PowerShell, depending on the operating system and shell being used.

* Here are some key aspects of shell scripting:

## Script File
* Shell scripts are plain text files with a specific extension, such as .sh for Bash scripts. They usually start with a shebang (#!) line that specifies the path to the shell interpreter.

## Variables
* Shell scripts support variables to store and manipulate data. Variables are declared without specifying a type and can hold strings, numbers, or other values.

* Example:
~~~~
# Variable declaration and assignment
name="John"
age=25

# Variable usage
echo "My name is $name and I'm $age years old."
~~~~

## Control Structures
* Shell scripts support control structures like conditionals and loops to make decisions and repeat actions.

* Example (if statement):
~~~~
if [ $age -ge 18 ]; then
  echo "You are an adult."
else
  echo "You are a minor."
fi
~~~

* Example (for loop)
~~~~
for i in {1..5}; do
  echo "Iteration $i"
done
~~~~

## Command Execution
* Shell scripts can execute shell commands and capture their output or exit status.

* Example:
~~~~
# Command execution and capturing output
files=$(ls)
echo "Files: $files"

# Command execution and capturing exit status
grep "pattern" file.txt
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Pattern found."
else
  echo "Pattern not found."
fi
~~~~

## Input and Output
* Shell scripts can read input from users or files and write output to the console or files.

* Example:
~~~~
# Reading user input
read -p "Enter your name: " username
echo "Hello, $username!"

# Redirecting output to a file
echo "Some content" > output.txt

# Appending output to a file
echo "More content" >> output.txt
~~~~

## Functions
* Shell scripts can define functions to encapsulate a set of commands and reuse them.

* Example:
~~~~
# Function definition
greet() {
  echo "Hello, $1!"
}

# Function invocation
greet "Alice"
greet "Bob"
~~~~

#### Shell scripting allows you to automate repetitive tasks, perform system administration tasks, and create complex workflows. It provides the power and flexibility to leverage the capabilities of the shell environment. You can refer to the documentation or online resources specific to your shell to learn more about its scripting features and syntax.
